By contrast,</div><div class="line">the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to</div><div class="line">share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free</div><div class="line">software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the</div><div class="line">GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to</div><div class="line">any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to</div><div class="line">your programs, too.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div><div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div><div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div><div class="line">them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</div><div class="line">want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</div><div class="line">free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</div><div class="line">these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have</div><div class="line">certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if</div><div class="line">you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div><div class="line">gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</div><div class="line">freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive</div><div class="line">or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they</div><div class="line">know their rights.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</div><div class="line">(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</div><div class="line">giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains</div><div class="line">that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&#39; and</div><div class="line">authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</div><div class="line">changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</div><div class="line">authors of previous versions.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</div><div class="line">modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer</div><div class="line">can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of</div><div class="line">protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software.  The systematic</div><div class="line">pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</div><div class="line">use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we</div><div class="line">have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</div><div class="line">products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</div><div class="line">stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</div><div class="line">of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</div><div class="line">States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</div><div class="line">software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to</div><div class="line">avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could</div><div class="line">make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that</div><div class="line">patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div><div class="line">modification follow.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  0. Definitions.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</div><div class="line">works, such as semiconductor masks.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</div><div class="line">License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and</div><div class="line">&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</div><div class="line">in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</div><div class="line">exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the</div><div class="line">earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based</div><div class="line">on the Program.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without</div><div class="line">permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</div><div class="line">infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</div><div class="line">computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,</div><div class="line">distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</div><div class="line">public, and in some countries other activities as well.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</div><div class="line">parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through</div><div class="line">a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;</div><div class="line">to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</div><div class="line">feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</div><div class="line">tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</div><div class="line">extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</div><div class="line">work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If</div><div class="line">the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</div><div class="line">menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  1. Source Code.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work</div><div class="line">for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source</div><div class="line">form of a work.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official</div><div class="line">standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</div><div class="line">interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</div><div class="line">is widely used among developers working in that language.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other</div><div class="line">than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</div><div class="line">packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</div><div class="line">Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</div><div class="line">Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</div><div class="line">implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A</div><div class="line">&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component</div><div class="line">(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</div><div class="line">(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</div><div class="line">produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all</div><div class="line">the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</div><div class="line">work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</div><div class="line">control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s</div><div class="line">System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</div><div class="line">programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</div><div class="line">which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source</div><div class="line">includes interface definition files associated with source files for</div><div class="line">the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</div><div class="line">linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</div><div class="line">such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</div><div class="line">subprograms and other parts of the work.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</div><div class="line">can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</div><div class="line">Source.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</div><div class="line">same work.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  2. Basic Permissions.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</div><div class="line">copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</div><div class="line">conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</div><div class="line">permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a</div><div class="line">covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</div><div class="line">content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your</div><div class="line">rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</div><div class="line">convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains</div><div class="line">in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose</div><div class="line">of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you</div><div class="line">with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with</div><div class="line">the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do</div><div class="line">not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works</div><div class="line">for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction</div><div class="line">and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of</div><div class="line">your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under</div><div class="line">the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10</div><div class="line">makes it unnecessary.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</div><div class="line">measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</div><div class="line">11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</div><div class="line">similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</div><div class="line">measures.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</div><div class="line">circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention</div><div class="line">is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</div><div class="line">the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or</div><div class="line">modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s</div><div class="line">users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of</div><div class="line">technological measures.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you</div><div class="line">receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</div><div class="line">appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</div><div class="line">keep intact all notices stating that this License and any</div><div class="line">non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</div><div class="line">keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</div><div class="line">recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</div><div class="line">and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</div><div class="line">produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</div><div class="line">terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified</div><div class="line">    it, and giving a relevant date.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</div><div class="line">    released under this License and any conditions added under section</div><div class="line">    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to</div><div class="line">    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this</div><div class="line">    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This</div><div class="line">    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7</div><div class="line">    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,</div><div class="line">    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no</div><div class="line">    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</div><div class="line">    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</div><div class="line">    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</div><div class="line">    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your</div><div class="line">    work need not make them do so.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</div><div class="line">works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</div><div class="line">and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,</div><div class="line">in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an</div><div class="line">&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not</div><div class="line">used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users</div><div class="line">beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work</div><div class="line">in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other</div><div class="line">parts of the aggregate.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</div><div class="line">of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</div><div class="line">machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</div><div class="line">in one of these ways:</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</div><div class="line">    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</div><div class="line">    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</div><div class="line">    customarily used for software interchange.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</div><div class="line">    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</div><div class="line">    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</div><div class="line">    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</div><div class="line">    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</div><div class="line">    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</div><div class="line">    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</div><div class="line">    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</div><div class="line">    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</div><div class="line">    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</div><div class="line">    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</div><div class="line">    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This</div><div class="line">    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</div><div class="line">    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</div><div class="line">    with subsection 6b.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</div><div class="line">    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</div><div class="line">    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</div><div class="line">    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the</div><div class="line">    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to</div><div class="line">    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</div><div class="line">    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</div><div class="line">    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</div><div class="line">    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</div><div class="line">    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the</div><div class="line">    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</div><div class="line">    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</div><div class="line">    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</div><div class="line">    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</div><div class="line">    charge under subsection 6d.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</div><div class="line">from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</div><div class="line">included in conveying the object code work.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any</div><div class="line">tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,</div><div class="line">or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation</div><div class="line">into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,</div><div class="line">doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular</div><div class="line">product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a</div><div class="line">typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status</div><div class="line">of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</div><div class="line">actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product</div><div class="line">is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</div><div class="line">commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</div><div class="line">the only significant mode of use of the product.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,</div><div class="line">procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install</div><div class="line">and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from</div><div class="line">a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must</div><div class="line">suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object</div><div class="line">code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</div><div class="line">modification has been made.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</div><div class="line">specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</div><div class="line">part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</div><div class="line">User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</div><div class="line">fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</div><div class="line">Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</div><div class="line">by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply</div><div class="line">if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</div><div class="line">modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has</div><div class="line">been installed in ROM).</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</div><div class="line">requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates</div><div class="line">for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for</div><div class="line">the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a</div><div class="line">network may be denied when the modification itself materially and</div><div class="line">adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and</div><div class="line">protocols for communication across the network.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</div><div class="line">in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly</div><div class="line">documented (and with an implementation available to the public in</div><div class="line">source code form), and must require no special password or key for</div><div class="line">unpacking, reading or copying.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  7. Additional Terms.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this</div><div class="line">License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</div><div class="line">Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</div><div class="line">be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent</div><div class="line">that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions</div><div class="line">apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately</div><div class="line">under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by</div><div class="line">this License without regard to the additional permissions.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</div><div class="line">remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</div><div class="line">it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own</div><div class="line">removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place</div><div class="line">additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,</div><div class="line">for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you</div><div class="line">add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of</div><div class="line">that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</div><div class="line">    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or</div><div class="line">    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal</div><div class="line">    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or</div><div class="line">    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in</div><div class="line">    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or</div><div class="line">    authors of the material; or</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some</div><div class="line">    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that</div><div class="line">    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of</div><div class="line">    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for</div><div class="line">    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on</div><div class="line">    those licensors and authors.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further</div><div class="line">restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you</div><div class="line">received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is</div><div class="line">governed by this License along with a term that is a further</div><div class="line">restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains</div><div class="line">a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this</div><div class="line">License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms</div><div class="line">of that license document, provided that the further restriction does</div><div class="line">not survive such relicensing or conveying.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</div><div class="line">must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the</div><div class="line">additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating</div><div class="line">where to find the applicable terms.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</div><div class="line">form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;</div><div class="line">the above requirements apply either way.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  8. Termination.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</div><div class="line">provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</div><div class="line">modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</div><div class="line">this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</div><div class="line">paragraph of section 11).</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</div><div class="line">license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</div><div class="line">provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</div><div class="line">finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright</div><div class="line">holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means</div><div class="line">prior to 60 days after the cessation.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</div><div class="line">reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</div><div class="line">violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</div><div class="line">received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</div><div class="line">copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</div><div class="line">your receipt of the notice.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</div><div class="line">licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</div><div class="line">this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</div><div class="line">reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</div><div class="line">material under section 10.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</div><div class="line">run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work</div><div class="line">occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</div><div class="line">to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,</div><div class="line">nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</div><div class="line">modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do</div><div class="line">not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</div><div class="line">covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</div><div class="line">receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</div><div class="line">propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible</div><div class="line">for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an</div><div class="line">organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</div><div class="line">organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered</div><div class="line">work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</div><div class="line">transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</div><div class="line">licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could</div><div class="line">give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</div><div class="line">Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</div><div class="line">the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</div><div class="line">rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may</div><div class="line">not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</div><div class="line">rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</div><div class="line">(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</div><div class="line">any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</div><div class="line">sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  11. Patents.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</div><div class="line">License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The</div><div class="line">work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims</div><div class="line">owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</div><div class="line">hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</div><div class="line">by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</div><div class="line">but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</div><div class="line">consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For</div><div class="line">purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant</div><div class="line">patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</div><div class="line">this License.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</div><div class="line">patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to</div><div class="line">make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</div><div class="line">propagate the contents of its contributor version.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express</div><div class="line">agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</div><div class="line">(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</div><div class="line">sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a</div><div class="line">party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</div><div class="line">patent against the party.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</div><div class="line">and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</div><div class="line">to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</div><div class="line">publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</div><div class="line">then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</div><div class="line">available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</div><div class="line">patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</div><div class="line">consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</div><div class="line">license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have</div><div class="line">actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</div><div class="line">covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work</div><div class="line">in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</div><div class="line">country that you have reason to believe are valid.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</div><div class="line">arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</div><div class="line">covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</div><div class="line">receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</div><div class="line">or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</div><div class="line">you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</div><div class="line">work and works based on it.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within</div><div class="line">the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</div><div class="line">conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</div><div class="line">specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered</div><div class="line">work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</div><div class="line">in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</div><div class="line">to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</div><div class="line">the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</div><div class="line">parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</div><div class="line">patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</div><div class="line">conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</div><div class="line">for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</div><div class="line">contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</div><div class="line">or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</div><div class="line">any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</div><div class="line">otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div><div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div><div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a</div><div class="line">covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div><div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</div><div class="line">not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you</div><div class="line">to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey</div><div class="line">the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this</div><div class="line">License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</div><div class="line">permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed</div><div class="line">under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single</div><div class="line">combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this</div><div class="line">License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</div><div class="line">but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,</div><div class="line">section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the</div><div class="line">combination as such.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  14. Revised Versions of this License.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</div><div class="line">the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</div><div class="line">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</div><div class="line">address new problems or concerns.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the</div><div class="line">Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General</div><div class="line">Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the</div><div class="line">option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered</div><div class="line">version or of any later version published by the Free Software</div><div class="line">Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the</div><div class="line">GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published</div><div class="line">by the Free Software Foundation.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future</div><div class="line">versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s</div><div class="line">public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you</div><div class="line">to choose that version for the Program.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  Later license versions may give you additional or different</div><div class="line">permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any</div><div class="line">author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a</div><div class="line">later version.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY</div><div class="line">APPLICABLE LAW.
