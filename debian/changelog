ffmpegfs (2.12-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The code has been run through clang-tidy to identify bug-prone or
    inefficient code, and to find parts that could be modernised to C++17.
    Several issues could be resolved. Sometimes, many lines of code could be
    replaced by a few. Some parts run far more inefficiently than before. C++17
    is cool. I need to get a t-shirt.
  * Bugfix: In get prores bitrate(), a crash that might have happened under
    unusual circumstances has been corrected. If the best match resolution
    could not be found, array access out-of-bounds could happen.
  * Bugfix: Several unlikely, but potential problems that could have happened
    when subtitle decoding failed or delayed video/audio packets couldn't be
    decoded have been fixed.
  * Bugfix: An internal problem could cause the application to crash. Should
    never happen, though. Fixed anyway.
  * Bugfix: Sometimes, the last segment's estimated size was incredibly small -
    about 2 bytes. Each segment should have the same predicted size as it is
    calculated simply by dividing the projected size of the entire file by the
    number of segments. Following transcoding, the size was accurate.

ffmpegfs (2.11-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Feature: Issue #86: Smart transcode now detects if a source file is audio
    only and uses the correct target format. For example, with
    --destination=webm+mp3, if one MP4 input file contains a video stream and
    another an audio stream only, the resulting files will be WebM (for the
    video input) and mp3 for the audio only file.
  * Feature: Issue #137: Add --no_subtitles option to turn subtitles off.
  * Bugfix: Smart encode selected the video format for cue sheet tracks,
    regardless of the input format. This has been fixed now.
  * Bugfix: Fix a crash that occurs when a DVD/Blu-ray is transcoded to audio
    only.
  * Bugfix: If the track performer field in the cuesheet is blank, try album
    performer instead.
  * Bugfix: Failing to mount Fuse during "make check" went unnoticed as the
    result code (which was supposed to be 99) was actually 0. Return the correct
    result code, failing the operation as expected.
  * Bugfix: The Docker build command contained a "make check" which actually
    failed altogether. Step has been removed. "make check" mounts Fuse, but this
    requires privileges that do not exist during "docker build".
  * Bugfix: On error, mremap () returns MAP_FAILED rather than NULL. Fixed a
    check for incorrect error conditions, which could cause the application to
    crash or return illogical error messages.
  * Bugfix: Issue #119: Fix a problem that caused frame set generation to fail
    sometimes. It seems to be related to the nremap() issue.
  * Generally revisited documentation, logging, and display texts. Improved
    grammar, formatting, and fixed quite a few typos that escaped all
    proofreading sessions.
  * The FFmpeg API INFO and DEBUG level log output has been changed to the
    FFmpegfs DEBUG level. What FFmpeg considers "INFO" is far too chatty.
  * Frequent memory reallocations when creating HLS segments have been reduced
    to speed up processing.
  * Optimised logging to save CPU time by not formatting log entries that are
    not written anyway at their log level.
  * Logging has been revised to shorten file paths and remove mount, input, and
    cache paths. Log the additional portion only to reduce log file size and
    improve readability.
  * Bugfix: To fix the build with GCC 12, add the missing include headers
    (closes: #1012925).

ffmpegfs (2.10-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Feature: Issue #123: New command line option to hide files by extension.
    Example: --hide_extensions=jpg,png,cue would stop covers and cue sheets
    from showing up.
  * Feature: Issue #120: Added subtitle support. Subtitle streams can now also
    be transcoded to the output files. Separate SRT or VTT files will be
    incorporated as subtitle streams.
  * Bugfix: Fixed memory leak in encode_audio_frame().
  * Bugfix: Issue #122: Last song was missing from cuesheet files.
  * Bugfix: Issue #129: Files remained zero size when previously transcoded.
  * Bugfix: Issue #130: Fix file sizes can be incorrectly reported by ls but
    are correct when data is read.
  * Bugfix: Duration was not saved in cache SQLite database.
  * Bugfix: Issue #131: Sometimes video parameters for some Bluray or DVD
    chapters cannot be detected by FFmpeg API. Transcode then failes - fixed
    by using data from the Bluray directory or DVD IFO instead.
  * Lowest supported FFmpeg API version raised to 4.1.8 "al-Khwarizmi".
  * Dropped libavresample support, library was removed from FFmpeg API after
    3.4.9.
  * Deprecated previous channel layout API based on uint64 bitmasks.
  * Deprecated swr_alloc_set_opts() and swr_build_matrix().
  * Going C++17 now: The packet queue has been recoded in C++17 to support
    external subtitles files. As C++17 is required now, why not go all the way:
    Starting to replace legacy C++ and somewhat C-like parts with real C++.
  * Using std::shared_ptr to ensure proper memory allocation/free.

ffmpegfs (2.9-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Feature: Issue #97: Added options to chose different codecs. The audio codec
    can be selected with --audiocodec, for videos use --videocodec.
  * Feature: Issue #109: Allow user defined file extensions for source files. By
    default, only standard extensions are accepted, i.e., mp4, ts, avi etc.
    Arbitrary file extensions can be defined now, e.g. using
    --extensions=xxx,abc,yxz,aaa to also convert files ending with .xxx, .abc
    and so on.
  * Feature: Issue #121: Added MKV support. New format can be selected with
    --desttype=mkv.
  * Bugfix: Issue #112: Fixed Docker detection.
  * Bugfix: Issue #110: Docker build command failed, added missing libchardet
    and allow libdvdread4 or *8 to be used, whatever available.
  * Bugfix: Fixed crash when video had no audio.
  * Bugfix: Issue #112: Fixed access problems with frame sets and HLS.
  * Bugfix: Issue #119: Fixed problem that caused frame set generation to
    sometimes fail.
  * Bugfix: Fixed JPG frame set generation. Suddenly FF_COMPLIANCE_UNOFFICIAL
    was required to have FFmpeg API accept the codec.
  * Enhancement: Issue #67: Enhance file size prediction.
  * Bugfix: Need to synchronise screen log. Concurrent entries by separate flags
    created garbled output.
  * Bugfix: Avoid creating an HLS segment number which is out of bounds
    (higher than the expected number of segments).
  * Enhancement: Removed QMake support, replaced with CMake.

ffmpegfs (2.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bugfix: Issue #102: Not all SQL queries where case sensitive, causing cache
    confusion. Several database entries were created, but only one was updated.
    Made all queries case sensitive.
  * Bugfix: Issue #91: Fixed HLS problems with cache causing garbled videos and
    hick-ups in audio. Make sure that the cache is clean when transcoding
    starts.
    There should be no remains left, all segments must be created or recreated
    anyway. Do not append to cache when writing. This caused cache files to
    become larger and larger.
  * Enhancement: Issue #103: If requested HLS segment is less than X
    (adjustable) seconds away, discard seek request. Segment would be available
    very soon anyway, and that seek makes a re-transcode necessary. Can be set
    with --min_seek_time_diff. Defaults to 30 seconds.
  * Feature: Issue #105: Added Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) support.
    Activate with *--desttype=FLAC*.
  * Feature: Issue #101: Sample format for audio files can be selected via
    command line with --audiosamplefmt. Possible values are 0 to use the
    predefined setting, 8, 16, 32, 64 for integer format, F16, F32, F64 for
    floating point.
    Not all formats are supported by all destination types, selecting an invalid
    format will be reported as error and a list of values printed.
    Defaults to 0 (Use same as source or the predefined format of the
    destination if source format is not possible).

ffmpegfs (2.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bugfix: Issue #92: Fixed crash when hardware decoding failed. The problem
    is that the FFmpeg API very late reports that it cannot decode the file in
    hardware. To find out about that, the source file must be decoded until the
    first video frame is encountered.
    It would be very time consuming to do this on every file (decode until it
    is clear that the file is supported, then actually start transcoding it
    from scratch). There is no feasible way to automatically handle the
    situation. To get around this a --hwaccel_dec_blocked parameter has been
    added.
    If hardware decoding fails, check the log for a message similar this:
    "[vp9 @ 0x7fe910016080] No support for codec vp9 profile 0."
    If VP9 profile 0 is not supported, the parameter would be:
    --hwaccel_dec_blocked=VP9:0
    This will tell FFmpegfs to decode the file in software. To block VP9
    as a whole, the parameter would be --hwaccel_dec_blocked=VP9. To block
    both profile 0 and 1, use --hwaccel_dec_blocked=VP9:0:1.
    The parameter can be repeated to block even more codecs.
  * Bugfix: Issue #96: Fixed potential buffer overrun and crash when reading
    corrupted input files.
  * Enhancement: Issue #99: Report command line error if --desttype specifies
    audio format first, or if the second format is not audio only. Avoid
    misinterpretations. For example, --desttype=aiff+mov would create MOV
    files out of any input. Correct would be --desttype=mov+aiff which will
    create MOV files out of videos and AIFF from audio files, as expected.
  * Closes: #998860: Point d/watch at releases.

ffmpegfs (2.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Feature: Issue #63 - Hardware acceleration for encoding/decoding is partly
    implemented, VAAPI/MMAL/OMX/V4L2 are currently available only.
    - Supported hardware: V4L2/VAAPI (Intel) and V4L2/MMAL/OMX (Raspberry).
    - VAAPI: H264, H265/HEVC, MPEG-2 and VP-8 decoding and H264 encoding.
    - VAAPI: MJPEG and VC-9 do not work (yet).
    - MMAL: H264, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 and VC1 decoding.
    - OMX: H264 encoding.
    - V4L2: H263, H264, H265, MPEG1/2/4, VC-1, VP8/9 encoding/decoding.
  * Feature: Added unit tests for hardware acceleration. Failing tests will
    report as SKIPPED and not fail the whole test.
  * Note: Which hardware en/decoder actually works depends on what your hardware
    supports.
  * Call for testers: Have a CUDA capable graphics adapter and interested in
    testing? Please write me an E-Mail.
  * Bugfix: Issue #90: Make sure that one keyframe gets inserted at the start of
    each HLS segment.
  * Enhancement: Issue #80: Open input video codec only if target supports
    video. Saves resources: no need to decode video frames if not used.
  * Enhancement: Issue #81: If source format has no audio, and the target
    supports no video (e.g.WAV/MP3), the files have shown up zero sized. These
    will now not be visible when doing ls. When trying to open them "File not
    found" will be returned.
  * Added "configure --enable-debug" to create binaries with debug symbols.
    Defaults to the optimised version.
  * Feature: Issue #73: Cue sheet tracks now play "gapless" if played in order.
    Whenever a track is started, the next track will automatically be transcoded
    as well.
  * Feature: Issue #66 and issue #82: Added cue sheet support. If a file with
    cue extension is found with the same name as a media file or if a cue sheet
    is embedded into it (a tag named CUESHEET), tracks defined in it will show
    up in a virtual directory.
  * Feature: Issue #83: Character conversion for cue sheet files. Automatically
    detects the character encoding of the cue sheet. and converts as necessary.
  * Feature: Issue #78: Duplicate ARTIST to ALBUMARTIST tag if empty
  * Feature: Issue #79: Added Docker support.
  * Fixed deprecation: 2021-03-17 - f7db77bd87 - lavc 58.133.100 - codec.h
    Deprecated av_init_packet()
  * Fixed API compatibility: Many pointers made const as of 2021-04-27.
    Although reasonable, this breaks API compatibility with versions older
    than 59.0.100,
  * Bugfix: find_original "fallback" method did not correctly handle the new
    filename format (extension added, not the original one replaced).
  * Bugfix: Issue #87: Segments are now properly separated, making sure that
    e.g. segment 3 only goes from 30 seconds up to 40 (including 30, but not
    40 seconds).
  * Bugfix: Issue #88: HLS audio and video now stay in sync after longer
    playback (more than 30 minutes) or after seek operations.

ffmpegfs (2.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * This is a maintenance release, bugfixes only.

  * Bugfix: Issue #75: Fix crash when opening mp3 output with Dolphin.
  * Bugfix: Issue #70: Possible crash in Buffer::init: Should not assert if
            duration is 0 (and thus segment count 0). Report internal error and
            go on.
  * Bugfix: Issue #70: Do not set duration to 0 from cache but leave unchanged.
            Caused HLS transcoding to fail if more than one transcoder was
            concurrently started.
  * Bugfix: Possible crash in transcoder_thread: Decoder object could have been
            used after being freed.
  * Bugfix: Stupid blooper. WAV and AIFF size was always calculated for a mono
            file, thus for stereo files resulting in only half the correct size.
  * Bugfix: Corrected documentation, "make checks" should read "make check",
            funny this went unnoticed for over 3 years...
  * Bugfix: Issue #74: Album arts were only copied from MP3/4 sources. Removed
            restriction, if the input file contains an album art it will be
            copied to the target (if supported, of course, e.g., to mp3 or mp4.
            Ogg is not yet supported because embedding album arts in Ogg can
            only be done by an unofficial workaround).
  * Bugfix: Issue #71:: Virtual directories were missing dot and dot-dot nodes.

ffmpegfs (2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Feature: Add BLURAY_VIDEO_FORMAT_2160P (UHD)
  * Feature: Implemented in 1.7, removed experimental state for --win_smb_fix
             now. Windows seems to access the files on Samba drives starting
             at the last 64K segment simply when the file is opened. Setting
             --win_smb_fix=1 will ignore these attempts (not decode the file
             up to this point).
  * Feature: --win_smb_fix now defaults to 1 (fix on by default). Has no effect
             if the drive is accessed directly or via Samba from Linux.
  * Bugfix: Fixed grammatical error in text: It's "access to", not "access at".
  * Bugfix: Did not transcode some source files with invalid DTS.
  * Bugfix: Cosmetical - No need to log date/time twice in syslog.
  * Bugfix: Cosmetical - Fix man page/online help for --recodesame parameter.
  * Bugfix: Report correct segment duration
  * Bugfix: Avoid crash if opening next HLS segment failed. Should not ignore
            this, but report it instead and stop transcoding.
  * Cosmetical: Log cache close action at trace level
  * Cosmetical: Shorter log entry when opening cache files

ffmpegfs (1.98-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added patch for cross build. (Closes: #958928)
    ffmpegfs fails to cross build from source, because it uses AC_RUN_IFELSE
    without an alternative for cross compilation. In this case,
    AC_RUN_IFELSE is entirely unnecessary, because AC_CHECK_SIZEOF works.

  * Removed -march command line option. (Closes: #958646)
    Some architectures, namely powerpc ppc64 ppc64el, do not support the
    -march command line option. Removed from Makefile.
    Fixed upstream for 1.99 also.

ffmpegfs (1.98-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cool, there's an online revivew on Linux Uprising, you can read it here:
    https://www.linuxuprising.com/2020/03/ffmpegfs-is-fuse-based-filesystem-for.html
  * Feature: HLS: Introducing direct segment access. If e.g. segment
            no. 333 is opened, ffmpegfs will seek to this position and start
            transcoding the segment immediately.
  * Support: No longer creating a user/group ffmpegfs while "make install".
            The user is not really required, just bloats the system's user
            database.
  * Support: Reduced quality of the test video to make the distribution
            archive slimmer. A full HD (1920x1280) video at 60 frames per
            second was a bit of an overkill anyway. 720x400 at 30 fps
            should be enough for everybody.
  * Feature: Cache dir changed to ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/ffmpegfs (as
             specified in the XDG Base Directory Specification). Falls back
             to ${HOME:-~/.cache}/ffmpegfs if not defined. Only if executed
             with root privileges, "/var/cache/ffmpegfs" will be used e.g.
             if invoked via /etc/fstab entry).
  * Feature: Changed PTS generation: For DVD/Bluray chapters they will not
             start at 0 for each chapter, but at the real time the chapter
             begins in its title. Fixes #51.
  * Feature: Issue #52 - Added --audiochannels option to select a different
             number of channels. Defaults to 2 (stereo), may be set to 1 to
             create mono files. Set to 0 to keep the original number of
             channels.
  * Bugfix: Issue #46 - Ensure the selected bitrate is used. Files could
            become much larger than expected. There's a strange FFmpeg API
            behaviour behind that, added the solution used in ffmpeg.c to
            fix.
  * Bugfix: Issue #48 - Properly handle incorrectly authored DVDs with
            missing SRI_END_OF_CELL marks after cells.
  * Bugfix: Issue #49 - Avoid creating HLS last segments shorter than
            200 ms, avoid stalls when the total playtime is a multiple of
            the segment size, e.g. 10 seconds.
  * Bugfix: Issue #54 - Made sure no duplicate filenames get created. This
            changes the output name scheme, e.g. if two files xyz.ts and
            xyz.wmv exist and the destination type is mp4, two output files
            named xyz.ts.mp4 and xyz.wmv.mp4 appear. An additional file
            xyz.mp4 will show up with its real name.
            To continue using the old names, add --oldnamescheme=1 to the
            command line.
  * Bugfix: Online help and docs state --autocopy=OFF would turn the
            function off, but this actually was NONE. Changed to match
            documentation.
  * Libav support has been dropped. There is not activity on
    https://git.libav.org/?p=libav.git since 21.08.2019, and some features
    that FFmpegfs required were already lagging behind FFmpeg API.
    Supporting Libav already bound a lot of my time that I could better
    spend on new features or fixes for FFmpegfs.

ffmpegfs (1.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * make install no longer creates a user/group ffmpeg. Caused problems when
    building packages for Debian. The cache directory /var/cache/ffmepgfs is
    now created as user root, but the group is changed to users. If the data-
    base ist created as root regular users will be denied access anyway.
  * Created own recordings of raven.flac and nimmermehr.ogg (German version of
    raven.flac) and put all under CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0). Added
    license/copyright for test/srcdir/* into debian/copyright.
  * Feature: Added checks for mov/mp4/prores/webm video format.
  * Bugfix: Moved video deinterlace filtering before rescaling. Deinterlace does
            not work properly on rescaled videos, what a surprise. Especially
            caused strange results on Bluray sources, created blurred frames if
            downscaled from HD to SD (or lower) before deinterlacing.
  * Bugfix: Avoid EINVAL errors in case the cache file ends up at zero size.
            Minor problem, but ugly.
  * Bugfix: Cache structure was not properly initialised, causing invalid values
            in the database.
  * Bugfix: Skip corrupted and discarded video frames to avoid blurps.
  * Bugfix: Corrected mistake in online help: clear-cache should be clear_cache
            instead.
  * Bugfix: Issue #43 - fix garbled first 12 frames. Enhanced overall picture
            quality.
  * Workaround: Issue #45 - fix garbled Bluray/DVD playback. Just a workaround,
                the problem is somewhere else.
  * Known bug: Libav support for videos seems broken. Not sure if this will be
