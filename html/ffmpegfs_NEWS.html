<div class="line">Important changes in 2.14 (2023-02-XX):</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Closes #141: Improved memory management by allocating several times the</div>
<div class="line">  average size of allocations. This prevents obtaining tiny portions over and over</div>
<div class="line">  again. Additionally, after the file is opened, grab the entire expected memory</div>
<div class="line">  block rather than doing a tiny allocation initially, followed by a larger</div>
<div class="line">  allocation.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Avoid race conditions that cause the inter-process semaphore creation to</div>
<div class="line">  fail for the second process.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #119: If a seek request is still open after EOF, restart</div>
<div class="line">  transcoding.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #119: To prevent frame/segment creation errors, the frame set and</div>
<div class="line">  HLS code has been updated.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Avoid crashes during shutdown if cache objects have already been closed.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #119: The AVSEEK_FLAG_FRAME set should be used to seek to frames</div>
<div class="line">  when building frame sets. Otherwise, output images may vary if searched for or</div>
<div class="line">  continuously decoded.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: The conversion of PTS to frame number and vice versa for frame sets was</div>
<div class="line">  incorrect if TBR did not equal frames per second.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed seek requests that are being ignored with frame sets.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: When transferring from cache to the Fuse buffer, avoid a possible 1 byte</div>
<div class="line">  overrun.</div>
<div class="line">* Enhancement: Record milliseconds for every log event.</div>
<div class="line">* Enhancement: make check: added a file size check to frame set tests.</div>
<div class="line">* Optimisation: When reopening after invalidating the cache, the size remained</div>
<div class="line">  at 0. The original size is now once again reserved in order to prevent</div>
<div class="line">  reallocations.</div>
<div class="line">* Optimisation: To avoid reallocations, save enough space in the cache buffer to</div>
<div class="line">  hold the entire frame set.</div>
<div class="line">* Optimisation: Checking folders to see if they can be transcoded is completely</div>
<div class="line">  pointless. Directories are now immediately skipped.</div>
<div class="line">* To avoid problems with logfile viewers, renamed built-in logfiles to</div>
<div class="line">  *_builtin.log (removing the double extension).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 2.13 (2023-01-15):</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Added --prebuffer_time parameter. Files will be decoded until the buffer</div>
<div class="line">  contains the specified playing time, allowing playback to start smoothly</div>
<div class="line">  without lags. Works similar to --prebuffer_size but gives better control</div>
<div class="line">  because it does not depend on the bit rate. An example: when set to</div>
<div class="line">  25 seconds for HLS transcoding, this will make sure that at least 2 complete</div>
<div class="line">  segments will be available once the file is released and visible.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Closes #140: Filtering the files that will be encoded has been</div>
<div class="line">  added. A comma-separated list of extensions is specified by the</div>
<div class="line">  --include_extensions parameter. These file extensions are the only ones that</div>
<div class="line">  will be transcoded.</div>
<div class="line">  The entries support shell wildcard patterns.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: The --hide_extensions parameter syntax has been extended. The</div>
<div class="line">  entries now support shell wildcard patterns.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Closes #139: Additional files could be added using the --extensions</div>
<div class="line">  parameter. However, this is no longer necessary; in the past, a file&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">  extension determined whether or not it would be transcoded. Files with</div>
<div class="line">  unknown extensions would be ignored. The extension is no longer important</div>
<div class="line">  because FFmpegfs now examines all input files and recognises transcodable</div>
<div class="line">  files by the format.</div>
<div class="line">  The outdated --extensions argument was removed without substitution.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed crash when implode() function was called with an empty string.</div>
<div class="line">  Happened with Windows GCC 11.3.0 only.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 2.12 (2022-08-27):</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* The code has been run through clang-tidy to identify bug-prone or</div>
<div class="line">  inefficient code, and to find parts that could be modernised to C++17.</div>
<div class="line">  Several issues could be resolved. Sometimes, many lines of code could be</div>
<div class="line">  replaced by a few. Some parts run far more efficiently than before. C++17</div>
<div class="line">  is cool. I need to get a t-shirt.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: In get prores bitrate(), a crash that might have happened under</div>
<div class="line">  unusual circumstances has been corrected. If the best match resolution</div>
<div class="line">  could not be found, array access out-of-bounds could happen.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Several unlikely, but potential problems that could have happened</div>
<div class="line">  when subtitle decoding failed or delayed video/audio packets couldn&#39;t be</div>
<div class="line">  decoded have been fixed.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: An internal problem could cause the application to crash. Should</div>
<div class="line">  never happen, though. Fixed anyway.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Sometimes, the last segment&#39;s estimated size was incredibly small -</div>
<div class="line">  about 2 bytes. Each segment should have the same predicted size as it is</div>
<div class="line">  calculated simply by dividing the projected size of the entire file by the</div>
<div class="line">  number of segments. Following transcoding, the size was accurate.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 2.11 (2022-06-16):</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #86: Smart transcode now detects if a source file is audio only</div>
<div class="line">  and uses the correct target format. For example, with --destination=webm+mp3, if</div>
<div class="line">  one MP4 input file contains a video stream and another an audio stream only,</div>
<div class="line">  the resulting files will be WebM (for the video input) and mp3 for the audio only</div>
<div class="line">  file.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #137: Add --no_subtitles option to turn subtitles off.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Smart encode selected the video format for cue sheet tracks, regardless</div>
<div class="line">  of the input format. This has been fixed now.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fix a crash that occurs when a DVD/Blu-ray is transcoded to audio only.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: If the track performer field in the cuesheet is blank, try album</div>
<div class="line">  performer instead.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Failing to mount Fuse during &quot;make check&quot; went unnoticed as the result</div>
<div class="line">  code (which was supposed to be 99) was actually 0. Return the correct result</div>
<div class="line">  code, failing the operation as expected.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: The Docker build command contained a &quot;make check&quot; which actually failed</div>
<div class="line">  altogether. Step has been removed. &quot;make check&quot; mounts Fuse, but this requires</div>
<div class="line">  privileges that do not exist during &quot;docker build&quot;.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: On error, mremap () returns MAP_FAILED rather than NULL. Fixed a check</div>
<div class="line">  for incorrect error conditions, which could cause the application to crash or</div>
<div class="line">  return illogical error messages.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #119: Fix a problem that caused frame set generation to fail</div>
<div class="line">  sometimes. It seems to be related to the nremap() issue.</div>
<div class="line">* Generally revisited documentation, logging, and display texts. Improved grammar,</div>
<div class="line">  formatting, and fixed quite a few typos that escaped all proofreading sessions.</div>
<div class="line">* The FFmpeg API INFO and DEBUG level log output has been changed to the</div>
<div class="line">  FFmpegfs DEBUG level. What FFmpeg considers &quot;INFO&quot; is far too chatty.</div>
<div class="line">* Frequent memory reallocations when creating HLS segments have been reduced to</div>
<div class="line">  speed up processing.</div>
<div class="line">* Optimised logging to save CPU time by not formatting log entries that are not</div>
<div class="line">  written anyway at their log level.</div>
<div class="line">* Logging has been revised to shorten file paths and remove mount, input, and</div>
<div class="line">  cache paths. Log the additional portion only to reduce log file size and improve</div>
<div class="line">  readability.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: To fix the build with GCC 12, add the missing include headers</div>
<div class="line">  (closes: #1012925).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 2.10 (2022-04-26):</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #123: New command line option to hide files by extension. Example:</div>
<div class="line">  --hide_extensions=jpg,png,cue would stop covers and cue sheets from showing up.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #120: Added subtitle support. Subtitle streams can now also be</div>
<div class="line">  transcoded to the output files. Separate SRT or VTT files will be incorporated</div>
<div class="line">  as subtitle streams.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed memory leak in encode_audio_frame().</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #122: Last song was missing from cuesheet files.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #129: Files remained zero size when previously transcoded.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #130: Fix file sizes can be incorrectly reported by ls but are</div>
<div class="line">  correct when data is read.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Duration was not saved in cache SQLite database.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #131: Sometimes video parameters for some Blu-ray or DVD chapters</div>
<div class="line">  cannot be detected by FFmpeg API. Transcode then failes - fixed by using data</div>
<div class="line">  from the Blu-ray directory or DVD IFO instead.</div>
<div class="line">* Lowest supported FFmpeg API version raised to 4.1.8 &quot;al-Khwarizmi&quot;.</div>
<div class="line">* Dropped libavresample support, library was removed from FFmpeg API after 3.4.9.</div>
<div class="line">* Deprecated previous channel layout API based on uint64 bitmasks.</div>
<div class="line">* Deprecated swr_alloc_set_opts() and swr_build_matrix().</div>
<div class="line">* Going C++17 now: The packet queue has been recoded in C++17 to support</div>
<div class="line">  external subtitles files. As C++17 is required now, why not go all the way:</div>
<div class="line">  Starting to replace legacy C++ and somewhat C-like parts with real C++.</div>
<div class="line">* Using std::shared_ptr to ensure proper memory allocation/free.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 2.9 (2022-02-16):</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #97: Added options to chose different codecs. The audio codec</div>
<div class="line">  can be selected with --audiocodec, for videos use --videocodec.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #109: Allow user defined file extensions for source files. By</div>
<div class="line">  default, only standard extensions are accepted, i.e., mp4, ts, avi etc.</div>
<div class="line">  Arbitrary file extensions can be defined now, e.g. using</div>
<div class="line">  --extensions=xxx,abc,yxz,aaa to also convert files ending with .xxx, .abc and</div>
<div class="line">  so on.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #121: Added MKV support. New format can be selected with</div>
<div class="line">  --desttype=mkv.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #112: Fixed Docker detection.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #110: Docker build command failed, added missing libchardet</div>
<div class="line">  and allow libdvdread4 or *8 to be used, whatever available.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed crash when video had no audio.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #112: Fixed access problems with frame sets and HLS.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #119: Fixed problem that caused frame set generation to</div>
<div class="line">  fail sometimes.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed JPG frame set generation. Suddenly FF_COMPLIANCE_UNOFFICIAL was</div>
<div class="line">  required to have FFmpeg API accept the codec.</div>
<div class="line">* Enhancement: Issue #67: Enhance file size prediction.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Need to synchronise screen log. Concurrent entries by separate flags</div>
<div class="line">  created garbled output.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Avoid creating an HLS segment number which is out of bounds</div>
<div class="line">  (higher than the expected number of segments).</div>
<div class="line">* Enhancement: Removed QMake support, replaced with CMake.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 2.8 (2021-11-29):</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #102: Not all SQL queries where case sensitive, causing cache</div>
<div class="line">  confusion. Several database entries were created, but only one was updated.</div>
<div class="line">  Made all queries case sensitive.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #91: Fixed HLS problems with cache causing garbled videos and</div>
<div class="line">  hick-ups in audio. Make sure that the cache is clean when transcoding starts.</div>
<div class="line">  There should be no remains left, all segments must be created or recreated</div>
<div class="line">  anyway. Do not append to cache when writing. This caused cache files to</div>
<div class="line">  become larger and larger.</div>
<div class="line">* Enhancement: Issue #103: If requested HLS segment is less than X (adjustable)</div>
<div class="line">  seconds away, discard seek request. Segment would be available very soon</div>
<div class="line">  anyway, and that seek makes a re-transcode necessary. Can be set with</div>
<div class="line">  --min_seek_time_diff. Defaults to 30 seconds.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #105: Added Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) support.</div>
<div class="line">  Activate with *--desttype=FLAC*.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #101: Sample format for audio files can be selected via</div>
<div class="line">  command line with --audiosamplefmt. Possible values are 0 to use the predefined</div>
<div class="line">  setting, 8, 16, 32, 64 for integer format, F16, F32, F64 for floating point.</div>
<div class="line">  Not all formats are supported by all destination types, selecting an invalid</div>
<div class="line">  format will be reported as error and a list of values printed.</div>
<div class="line">  Defaults to 0 (Use same as source or the predefined format of the destination</div>
<div class="line">  if source format is not possible).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 2.7 (2021-11-08):</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #92: Fixed crash when hardware decoding failed. The problem</div>
<div class="line">  is that the FFmpeg API very late reports that it cannot decode the file in</div>
<div class="line">  hardware. To find out about that, the source file must be decoded until the</div>
<div class="line">  first video frame is encountered.</div>
<div class="line">  It would be very time consuming to do this on every file (decode until it</div>
<div class="line">  is clear that the file is supported, then actually start transcoding it</div>
<div class="line">  from scratch). There is no feasible way to automatically handle the</div>
<div class="line">  situation. To get around this a --hwaccel_dec_blocked parameter has been</div>
<div class="line">  added.</div>
<div class="line">  If hardware decoding fails, check the log for a message similar this:</div>
<div class="line">  &quot;[vp9 @ 0x7fe910016080] No support for codec vp9 profile 0.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">  If VP9 profile 0 is not supported, the parameter would be:</div>
<div class="line">  --hwaccel_dec_blocked=VP9:0</div>
<div class="line">  This will tell FFmpegfs to decode the file in software. To block VP9</div>
<div class="line">  as a whole, the parameter would be --hwaccel_dec_blocked=VP9. To block</div>
<div class="line">  both profile 0 and 1, use --hwaccel_dec_blocked=VP9:0:1.</div>
<div class="line">  The parameter can be repeated to block even more codecs.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #96: Fixed potential buffer overrun and crash when reading</div>
<div class="line">  corrupted input files.</div>
<div class="line">* Enhancement: Issue #99: Report command line error if --desttype specifies</div>
<div class="line">  audio format first, or if the second format is not audio only. Avoid</div>
<div class="line">  misinterpretations. For example, --desttype=aiff+mov would create MOV</div>
<div class="line">  files out of any input. Correct would be --desttype=mov+aiff which will</div>
<div class="line">  create MOV files out of videos and AIFF from audio files, as expected.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 2.6 (2021-09-04):</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* No new features, just a bugfix. See V2.4 for details.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 2.5 (2021-06-18)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #63 - Hardware acceleration for encoding/decoding is partly</div>
<div class="line">  implemented, VAAPI/MMAL/OMX/V4L2 are currently available only.</div>
<div class="line">  - Supported hardware: V4L2/VAAPI (Intel) and V4L2/MMAL/OMX (Raspberry).</div>
<div class="line">  - VAAPI: H264, H265/HEVC, MPEG-2 and VP-8 decoding and H264 encoding.</div>
<div class="line">  - VAAPI: MJPEG and VC-9 do not work (yet).</div>
<div class="line">  - MMAL: H264, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 and VC1 decoding.</div>
<div class="line">  - OMX: H264 encoding.</div>
<div class="line">  - V4L2: H263, H264, H265, MPEG1/2/4, VC-1, VP8/9 encoding/decoding.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Added unit tests for hardware acceleration. Failing tests will</div>
<div class="line">           report as SKIPPED and not fail the whole test.</div>
<div class="line">* Note: Which hardware en/decoder actually works depends on what your hardware</div>
<div class="line">        supports.</div>
<div class="line">* Call for testers: Have a CUDA capable graphics adapter and interested in</div>
<div class="line">  testing? Please write me an E-Mail.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 2.4 (2021-09-04)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #90: Make sure that one keyframe gets inserted at the start of</div>
<div class="line">          each HLS segment.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 2.3 (2021-06-11)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Enhancement: Issue #80: Open input video codec only if target supports</div>
<div class="line">  video. Saves resources: no need to decode video frames if not used.</div>
<div class="line">* Enhancement: Issue #81: If source format has no audio, and the target supports</div>
<div class="line">  no video (e.g.WAV/MP3), the files have shown up zero sized. These will now not</div>
<div class="line">  be visible when doing ls. When trying to open them &quot;File not found&quot; will be</div>
<div class="line">  returned.</div>
<div class="line">* Added &quot;configure --enable-debug&quot; to create binaries with debug symbols.</div>
<div class="line">  Defaults to the optimised version.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #73: Cue sheet tracks now play &quot;gapless&quot; if played in order.</div>
<div class="line">  Whenever a track is started, the next track will automatically be transcoded</div>
<div class="line">  as well.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #66 and issue #82: Added cue sheet support. If a file with cue</div>
<div class="line">  extension is found with the same name as a media file or if a cue sheet is</div>
<div class="line">  embedded into it (a tag named CUESHEET), tracks defined in it will show up in a</div>
<div class="line">  virtual directory.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #83: Character conversion for cue sheet files. Automatically</div>
<div class="line">  detects the character encoding of the cue sheet. and converts as necessary.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #78: Duplicate ARTIST to ALBUMARTIST tag if empty</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #79: Added Docker support.</div>
<div class="line">* Fixed deprecation: 2021-03-17 - f7db77bd87 - lavc 58.133.100 - codec.h</div>
<div class="line">  Deprecated av_init_packet()</div>
<div class="line">* Fixed API compatitbility: Many pointers made const as of 2021-04-27. Although</div>
<div class="line">  reasonable, this breaks API compatibility with versions older than 59.0.100,</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: find_original &quot;fallback&quot; method did not correctly handle the new filename</div>
<div class="line">  format (extension added, not the original one replaced).</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #87: Segments are now properly separated, making sure that e.g.</div>
<div class="line">  segment 3 only goes from 30 seconds up to 40 (including 30, but not 40 seconds).</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #88: HLS audio and video now stay in sync after longer playback</div>
<div class="line">  (more than 30 minutes) or after seek operations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 2.2 (2021-02-06)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This is a maintenance release, bugfixes only.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #75: Fix crash when opening mp3 output with Dolphin.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #70: Possible crash in Buffer::init: Should not assert if duration is 0</div>
<div class="line">          (and thus segment count 0). Report internal error and go on.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #70: Do not set duration to 0 from cache but leave unchanged. Caused HLS</div>
<div class="line">          transcoding to fail if more than one transcoder was concurrently started.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Possible crash in transcoder_thread: Decoder object could have been used</div>
<div class="line">          after being freed.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Stupid blooper. WAV and AIFF size was always calculated for a mono file,</div>
<div class="line">          thus for stereo files resulting in only half the correct size.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Corrected documentation, &quot;make checks&quot; should read &quot;make check&quot;, funny this</div>
<div class="line">          went unnoticed for over 3 years...</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #74: Album arts were only copied from MP3/4 sources. Removed restriction,</div>
<div class="line">          if the input file contains an album art it will be copied to the target (if</div>
<div class="line">          supported, of course, e.g., to mp3 or mp4. Ogg is not yet supported because</div>

<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Add BLURAY_VIDEO_FORMAT_2160P (UHD)</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Implemented in 1.7, removed experimental state for --win_smb_fix now.</div>
<div class="line">           Windows seems to access the files on Samba drives starting at the last 64K segment</div>
<div class="line">           simply when the file is opened. Setting --win_smb_fix=1 will ignore these attempts</div>
<div class="line">           (not decode the file up to this point).</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: --win_smb_fix now defaults to 1 (fix on by default). Has no effect</div>
<div class="line">           if the drive is accessed directly or via Samba from Linux.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed grammatical error in text: It&#39;s &quot;access to&quot;, not &quot;access at&quot;.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Did not transcode some source files with invalid DTS.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Cosmetical - No need to log date/time twice in syslog.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Cosmetical - Fix man page/online help for --recodesame parameter.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Report correct segment duration</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Avoid crash if opening next HLS segment failed. Should not ignore this, but report</div>
<div class="line">          it instead and stop transcoding.</div>
<div class="line">* Cosmetical: Log cache close action at trace level</div>
<div class="line">* Cosmetical: Shorter log entry when opening cache files</div>

<div class="line">Important changes in 1.99 (2020-07-18)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Libav support has been dropped. There is no activity on https://git.libav.org/?p=libav.git</div>
<div class="line">  since 21.08.2019, and some features that FFmpegfs required were already lagging behind</div>
<div class="line">  FFmpeg API. Supporting Libav already bound a lot of my time that I could better spend</div>
<div class="line">  on new features or fixes for FFmpegfs.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Add PNG/BMP/JPG frame sets to &#39;make check&#39;. Checks number of files and cp</div>
<div class="line">           operations in arbitrary order with wildcards and absolute file names.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Add HLS segments to &#39;make check&#39;. Checks number of segments, the segment sizes</div>

<div class="line">           parameter to keep version information brief.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #61 - fix timeout problem when accessing JPG in arbitrary order.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #58 - Build list when ls/cp path/to/flles/00001.png is done. Access failed</div>
<div class="line">          because the file was not found.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #59 - *.m3u8 files were tried to be transcoded while they should simply be</div>
<div class="line">          passed through. Added to ignore and pass through list.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #57 - Correctly expand tilde when ~/ is used, for example in</div>
<div class="line">          &quot;ffmpegfs --logfile=~/ffmpegfs.log&quot;.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #60 - Reopen cache file after it has been closed so that image frames can</div>
<div class="line">          be accessed after the file has been fully decoded.</div>

<div class="line">Important changes in 1.98 (2020-04-15)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Cool, there&#39;s an online revivew on Linux Uprising, you can read it here:</div>
<div class="line">  https://www.linuxuprising.com/2020/03/ffmpegfs-is-fuse-based-filesystem-for.html</div>
<div class="line">* Support: FFmpegfs has recently been added to Debian sid and Debian Bullseye. It is also</div>
<div class="line">           available in Ubuntu 20.04 and Linux distributions based on it.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: HLS: Introducing direct segment access. If e.g. segment no. 333 is opened,</div>
<div class="line">           ffmpegfs will seek to this position and start transcoding the segment</div>
<div class="line">           immediately. *Please note that this feature is still experimental and may</div>
<div class="line">           produce unexpected results.*</div>
<div class="line">* Support: No longer creating a user/group ffmpegfs while &quot;make install&quot;. The user is not really</div>
<div class="line">           required, just bloats the system&#39;s user database.</div>
<div class="line">* Support: Reduced quality of the test video to make the distribution archive slimmer. A full</div>
<div class="line">           HD (1920x1280) video at 60 frames per second was a bit of an overkill anyway.</div>
<div class="line">           720x400 at 30 fps should be enough for everybody.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Cache dir changed to ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/ffmpegfs (as specified in the XDG</div>
<div class="line">           Base Directory Specification). Falls back to ${HOME:-~/.cache}/ffmpegfs if not</div>
<div class="line">           defined. Only if executed with root privileges, &quot;/var/cache/ffmpegfs&quot; will be used</div>
<div class="line">           (e.g. if invoked via /etc/fstab entry).</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Changed PTS generation: For DVD/Blu-ray chapters they will not start at 0 for each</div>
<div class="line">           chapter, but at the real time the chapter begins in its title. Fixes #51.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Issue #52 - Added --audiochannels option to select a different number of channels.</div>
<div class="line">           Defaults to 2 (stereo), may be set to 1 to create mono files. Set to 0 to keep the</div>
<div class="line">           original number of channels.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #46 - Ensure the selected bitrate is used. Files could become much larger than</div>
<div class="line">          expected. There&#39;s a strange FFmpeg API behaviour behind that, added the solution used</div>
<div class="line">          in ffmpeg.c to fix.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #48 - Properly handle incorrectly authored DVDs with missing SRI_END_OF_CELL</div>
<div class="line">          marks after cells.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #49 - Avoid creating HLS last segments shorter than 200 ms, avoid stalls when</div>
<div class="line">          the total playtime is a multiple of the segment size, e.g. 10 seconds.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #54 - Made sure no duplicate filenames get created. This changes the output name</div>
<div class="line">          scheme, e.g. if two files xyz.ts and xyz.wmv exist and the destination type is mp4,</div>
<div class="line">          two output files named xyz.ts.mp4 and xyz.wmv.mp4 appear. An additional file xyz.mp4</div>
<div class="line">          will show up with its real name.</div>
<div class="line">          To continue using the old names, add --oldnamescheme=1 to the command line.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Online help and docs state --autocopy=OFF would turn the function off, but this</div>
<div class="line">          actually was NONE. Changed to match documentation.</div>
<div class="line">* Known bug: Libav support for videos seems broken. Not sure if this will be fixed or Libav be</div>
<div class="line">          simply dropped.</div>

<div class="line">* Feature: Added checks for mov/mp4/prores/webm video format.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Moved video deinterlace filtering before rescaling. Deinterlace does not work properly on</div>
<div class="line">          rescaled videos, what a suprise. Especially caused strange results on Blu-ray sources,</div>
<div class="line">          created blurred frames if downscaled from HD to SD (or lower) before deinterlacing.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Avoid EINVAL errors in case the cache file ends up at zero size. Minor problem, but ugly.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Cache structure was not properly initialised, causing invalid values in the database.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Properly handle case when start_time is AV_NOPTS_VALUE (frame sets only)</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Corrected mistake in online help: clear-cache should be clear_cache instead.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Issue #43 - fix garbled first 12 frames. Enhanced overall picture quality.</div>
<div class="line">* Workaround: Issue #45 - fix garbled Blu-ray/DVD playback. Just a workaround, the problem is</div>
<div class="line">              somewhere else.</div>
<div class="line">* Due to copyright uncertanties and because the public domain license used is controversal, all</div>

<div class="line">* Feature: Reencode to same file format as source file. Normally files that already have the selected</div>

<div class="line">Important changes in 1.9 (2019-11-18)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Support: Code has now been tested to work on ARMv7 (32 bit).</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Documented the whole project with Doxygen.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Implemented a thread pool. File open (and thread starts) are now much faster than before.</div>
<div class="line">           The thread pool also ensures that not more threads than configured are started. Defaults</div>
<div class="line">           to 16x the number of processor cores available.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Added Apple Lossles Audio Compression (ALAC) support.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Added optional graphviz to configure, only required for Doxygen.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Updated INSTALL.md with missing prerequisites. Rearranged paragraphs, mentioning building</div>
<div class="line">           from git first was confusing.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Moved cache directory from rather unusual /tmp/ffmpegfs location to /var/cache/ffmpegfs.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed several warnings if compiled for 32 bit.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Removed unused xmlint prerequisite from configure.</div>

<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fix crash when Blu-ray video without audio was opened.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Cache files were left at the predicted size if it was larger than the result size.</div>
<div class="line">          Size is now correctly capped to the correct result size.</div>
<div class="line">* Fixed deprecation in fpcompare: 2018-04-01 - f1805d160d - lavfi 7.14.100 - avfilter.h</div>
<div class="line">    Deprecate use of avfilter_register(), avfilter_register_all(),</div>
<div class="line">    avfilter_next(). Added av_filter_iterate().</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 1.8 (2019-05-23)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This is a bugfix/maintenance release with only a few minor features added.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Added Doxygen documentation.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Report all errors together with error number.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: More detailed error handling.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Added &quot;make wipe-all&quot; to really clean up all generated files.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Do not report &quot;Not a directory&quot; error for virtual directories. Not an error, it&#39;s a feature.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed make dist: checks did not work.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed make clean: some Doxgen files were not removed.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Properly catch &quot;no memory&quot; errors.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Deinterlacing filter only worked for YUV videos.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Removed the check for invalid chapters - did not work as expected.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Wrong bitrate for PAL (was 30 fps instead of 25 fps) and assume PAL if bits are invalid.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed potential crash in DVD handling.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Do not add libavresample if libswresample is present. Saves build time.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Removed dependency on unused libdvdnav. Saves buildtime.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed two (probably rare but possible) crashes.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Image now not converted when the destination type is a video format.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 1.7 (2019-02-26)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Windows seems to access the files on Samba drives starting at the last 64K segment</div>
<div class="line">           simply when the file is opened. Setting --win_smb_fix=1 will ignore these attempts (not decode the</div>
<div class="line">           file up to this point).</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Added &quot;Auto Stream Copy&quot; option. This will copy audio or video streams to the output file rather than</div>
<div class="line">           recoding. Reduces computing time and CPU load.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Sped up DVD/Blu-ray/VCD access drastically. FUSE calls getattr like crazy, using cached data now.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Extended stream copy: now any codec can be copied if supported by target container using --autocopy=MATCH option.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Added full virtual titles to DVD, Blu-ray and Video CD. Creating one virtual file per chapter is very nice for</div>
<div class="line">       music disks as it allows access to every single title very easily. For movies it is better to have it in one</div>
<div class="line">       piece.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Enhanced win_smb_fix=1 functionality to hopefully catch all Windows incidents.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Added min_dvd_chapter_duration parameter. DVD chapters shorter than this will be ignored. Defaults to 1 second.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Decimal seconds in duration was wrong. Fixed.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: This was a bad one: The application crashed with a protection fault if there was not enough disk space</div>
<div class="line">          on the cache drive. This is now properly reported and transcoding aborted. Thanks for Muf for reporting</div>
<div class="line">          the issue.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed crash when DVD nav packet was missing</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed clang compatibility. Project did not build with clang, this has gone unnoticed for a while...</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed terrible miscalculation of DVD play time. No one told me the values are BCD, not decimal...</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed conversion of DVD chapters consisting of more than one cell.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed pts/dts generation</div>
<div class="line">* Known bug: Some Blurays are not recoded properly. The resulting files are much larger than expected, as a matter of</div>
<div class="line">             fact larger than the source (birates &gt; 27 MBit). Happens only for some sources.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 1.6 (2019-01-11)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Made all parameters like --profile case insensitive.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Added Apple MOV, Apple Prores and Apple AIFF formats.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Enable &quot;Smart Transcoding&quot;: To enable, specify --desttype=AUDIO+VIDEO, e.g.</div>

<div class="line">* Fixed deprecation:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 1.5 (2018-06-08)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Added WebM output format using VP9 video and Opus audio codec.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Input format check is now done by FFmpeg, that means if the input file is</div>
<div class="line">           supported by FFmpeg, it will be transcoded. For performance, files are not</div>
<div class="line">           opened and scanned, the file&#39;s extension is checked only (e.g. mp3, wav, rm etc.).</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Replaced mutagen-inspect with internal code which also works with WAV and WebM.</div>
<div class="line">           test_tags works for all formats now. python-mutagen is no longer required.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Check if sample rate or sample format is supported by audio codec and change if</div>
<div class="line">           necessary. Avoid transcode fails e.g. if 44.1KHz sampling rate is requested but</div>
<div class="line">           not supported (e.g. OPUS only supports 8K, 16K, 24K or 48K). Select nearest</div>
<div class="line">           supported sample rate or sample format.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Important changes in 1.4 (2018-05-30)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* The timeout for suspend and abort have been changed. Decoding will now be suspended</div>
<div class="line">  after 15 seconds (formerly 2 minutes). If no activity is detected after further 15 seconds</div>
<div class="line">  (formerly 3 minutes) decoding will be aborted. This will only happen if the file is actively</div>
<div class="line">  closed, so if playback is simply paused decoding will continue. The new limits proofed to</div>
<div class="line">  be fine and reduce system load significantly.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Enhanced logging, added a colour profile to screen logs and raised or lowered</div>
<div class="line">           some messages log levels appropriately. Also added a few informative log</div>
<div class="line">           messages.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Blu-ray support: Detect Blu-ray files in directories and list separate chapters</div>
<div class="line">           and titles as separate files.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: DVD support: Detect IFO files and list separate DVD chapters or programs</div>
<div class="line">           as separate files.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: S/VCD support: Detect Video CDs in directories and list chapters</div>
<div class="line">           as separate files.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Changed the fuse operations code module to c++ (minimise danger of</div>
<div class="line">           memory leaks or buffer overruns)</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Added --enablescript option that will add virtual index.php to every</div>
<div class="line">           directory. It reads scripts/videotag.php from the ffmpegs binary directory.</div>
<div class="line">           This can be very handy to test video playback. Of course, feel free to</div>
<div class="line">           replace videotag.php with your own script.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: By default ignore decoding errors so that transcoding does not stop just</div>
<div class="line">           because a few frames are garbled. Can be disabled with the &quot;decoding_errors&quot;</div>
<div class="line">           option.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Sometimes the pixel format could not be detected, raising an assert/application</div>
<div class="line">          crash with newer FFmpeg API versions. Fixed by setting it to the output format.</div>
<div class="line">          This will mostly ever create defect encoder results, but at least the FFmpegfs</div>
<div class="line">          process will not be shut down writing a core file.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Set mp4 profile to high/3.1 to enable playback under enable playback under</div>
<div class="line">          Win 7.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed formatting of help text.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Workaround: Fixed Libav support: Deinterlace code did not compile. Should be possible</div>
<div class="line">              to get it working, but for now it is simply disabled.</div>
<div class="line">              But honestly I don&#39;t want to get it working. I am thinking of dropping</div>
<div class="line">              Libav completely.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Fixed deprecation: 2018-xx-xx - xxxxxxx - lavf 58.9.100 - avformat.h</div>
<div class="line">    Deprecate use of  av_iformat_next(), av_oformat_next().</div>

<div class="line">* Feature: Set stream duration from source file as hint for encoder.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Enhanced logging output for better readability.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Added pre-buffer option. Files will be decoded up to this limit first</div>

<div class="line">* Feature: Enhanced configure that checks whether libavresample or libswresample</div>
<div class="line">           is present.</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Improved recoding detection. Files are recoded if the source file size</div>
<div class="line">           or timestamp changes, or different encoding options are selected</div>
<div class="line">           (e.g. a different bitrate, vidoe size etc.).</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: Allow profiles for target browsers or players. Currently selectable:</div>

<div class="line">           IE       optimise for MS Edge and Internet Explorer &lt;= 11</div>

<div class="line">* Feature: enhanced error output for SQLite (if supported by library version)</div>
<div class="line">* Feature: copy album arts from source if supported by target format (MP3/4).</div>
<div class="line">           Use --noalbumarts parameter to disable, e.g., for streaming files.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Only four lines of code: Avoid locking other clients when trying to get</div>
<div class="line">          the size of a file currently being decoded. Also speeds up directory</div>
<div class="line">          access quite significantly.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed lost frames at end of files (files where cut short)</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed crash when video files were transcoded to audio only (e.g. mp3)</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Make WAV size prediction more accurate</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Recode existing cache files if not found in database (handle database inconsistencies).</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Fixed sharing problems with sqlite database when accessed by multiple instances.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Files were truncated (mostly mp3) when cp&#39;ed directly while transcoding. Now files</div>
<div class="line">          will have the final size as expected.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Create valid WAV header for files transcoded on-the-fly.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Ensure a file gets recoded when the last attempt failed.</div>
<div class="line">* Bugfix: Ensure that transcoding errors get passed on to calling process, e.g. cp or rsync.</div>
<div class="line">          Otherwise copy operations might not notice that the file is invalid.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">FFMpeg has evolved, many API parts have been deprecated and will be dropped</div>
<div class="line">soon. This release adopts these changes by conditionally using the new</div>
<div class="line">APIs from the FFMpeg version on that they are available.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* Fixed deprecation: 2017-xx-xx - xxxxxxx - lavr 4.0.0 - avresample.h</div>
<div class="line">    Deprecate the entire library. Merged years ago to provide compatibility</div>
<div class="line">    with Libav, it remained unmaintained by the FFmpeg project and duplicated</div>
<div class="line">    functionality provided by libswresample.</div>
<div class="line">    swresample is the preferred library in FFMpeg, so it will be used if compiled</div>
<div class="line">    with FFMpeg by default, even before being deprecated. With libav, which</div>
<div class="line">    makes libavresample available only, the latter will be used.</div>
<div class="line">* Fixed deprecation: 2016-04-21 - 7fc329e - lavc 57.37.100 - avcodec.h</div>
<div class="line">    Added a new audio/video encoding and decoding API with decoupled input</div>

<div class="line">* Fixed deprecation: 2018-01-xx - xxxxxxx - lavf 58.7.100 - avformat.h</div>
<div class="line">    Deprecate AVFormatContext filename field which had limited length, use the</div>
<div class="line">    new dynamically allocated url field instead.</div>
<div class="line">* Fixed deprecation: 2018-xx-xx - xxxxxxx - lavf 58.9.100 - avformat.h</div>
<div class="line">    Deprecate use of av_register_input_format(), av_register_output_format(),</div>
<div class="line">    av_register_all(), av_iformat_next(), av_oformat_next().</div>
<div class="line">    NOTE: av_iformat_next/av_oformat_next() lack a replacement (currently</div>
<div class="line">    still used in tools/probetest.c &quot;static void probe&quot; in 58.10.100)</div>
<div class="line">* Fixed deprecation: 2018-xx-xx - xxxxxxx - lavc 58.10.100 - avcodec.h</div>
<div class="line">    Deprecate use of avcodec_register(), avcodec_register_all(),</div>

<div class="line">  video size change. If source video is larger it will be scaled down.</div>
<div class="line">  If already smaller the size will be left as is. You should only set</div>

<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Changes in this release:</div>
<div class="line">* Decided to rename mp3fs to FFmpegfs because the project has grown far beyond</div>
<div class="line">  a simple clone of mp3fs and the changes it will surely never be pushed back</div>
<div class="line">  to the parent project. A big random applause to the makers of mp3fs for giving</div>
<div class="line">  me a good head start!</div>

<div class="line">* Replaced decoding and encoding with FFmpeg.</div>
<div class="line">* Removed discrete FLAC/Ogg/MP3 libraries. FFmpeg supports a wide range of</div>

<div class="line">* Many other formats are possible, e.g. &quot;-o ogg&quot;, they will be added later</div>
